# ydf

## About

A dotfiles manager+

## Tested OS

It's tested on the following OS:

### Manjaro

Runtime Dependencies:

```sh
# SYSTEM: Linux yuniel-pc 6.1.51-1-MANJARO #1 SMP PREEMPT_DYNAMIC Sat Sep  2 23:22:36 UTC 2023 x86_64 GNU/Linux
# YAY
bash 5.1.016-3
```

⚠️ It should work on any linux distribution, but it has not been tested.

### Install

Clone the repository and switch to ydf directory

```sh
git clone https://github.com/yunielrc/ydf.git && cd ydf
```

#### Install on Manjaro

Install runtime dependencies and ydf on home directory

```sh
make install-run-manjaro && make install-tohome
```

For any other linux distribution install runtime dependencies manually and execute the following command

```sh
make install-tohome
```

## Configure

Edit the config file:

- If your OS is manjaro set the variable `YDF_PACKAGE_SERVICE_DEFAULT_OS` to manjaro. If you have any other distro OS don't set this variable.

```sh
vim ~/.ydf.env
```

## YDF Package

### What is a package?

A `package` is a directory that contains directories and files which some of
then has a special meaning for the `interpreter`. ydf is an `interpreter`.

### Which are the directories and files with special meaning?

These is an example of a `package` with 18 directories and files with special
meaning, those are `instructions` that work on any linux distribution:

```sh
package1
├── preinstall           # Script executed before install
├── install              # Script executed on install
├── @flatpak             # Install <package1> with flatpak
├── @snap                # Install <package1> with snap
├── docker-compose.yml   # Run docker compose up -d
├── package1.plugin.zsh  # Install yzsh plugin
├── homeln/              # Create symlinks on home for the first level files and
|                        # directories inside this directory
├── homelnr/             # Create symlinks on home for all files inside this
|                        # directory
├── homecp/              # Copy all files to home directory
├── rootcp/              # Copy all files to root directory
├── homecat/             # Concatenate all files to the existing one in home
├── rootcat/             # Concatenate all files to the existing one in root
├── homecps/             # Evaluate variables in files and copy them to home
├── rootcps/             # Evaluate variables in files and copy them to roo
├── homecats/            # Evaluate variables in files and concatenate them to
|                        # the existing ones in home
├── rootcats/            # Evaluate variables in files and concatenate them to
|                        # the existing ones in root directory
├── dconf.ini            # Load dconf settings
└── postinstall          # Script executed after all instructions
```

The `instructions` can be grouped in 4 categories:

- Scripts instructions: `preinstall`, `install`, `postinstall`.
  These instructions are shell scripts that are executed by bash.

- Package manager instructions: `@flatpak`, `@snap`.
  These instrucions are plain text files, the file can have inside one line with
  the package name or a list of packages names that are going to be installed.
  The file can be empty, in this case the package name (`package1`) is going to
  be used.

- Directory instructions: `homeln`, `homelnr`, `homecp`, `rootcp`, `homecat`,
  `rootcat`, `homecps`, `rootcps`, `homecats`, `rootcats`.
  These instructions are directories that contains files that are going to be
  copied, concatenated or symlinked to the home or root directory. For those
  that end with `s` all the variables inside each file are substituted with the
  values defined in the `envsubst.env` file that is inside the `package directory`.

- Tool files instructions: `docker-compose.yml`, `dconf.ini`, `package1.plugin.zsh`.
  These instructions are files that are going to be used by a tool. For example
  `docker-compose.yml` is going to be used by docker compose.
  The `package1.plugin.zsh` is a plugin that is going to be installed inside the
  YZSH data directory and used by YZSH.

There are 2 more `instructions` that only work for manjaro linux:

```sh
package2
├── @pacman
└── @yay
```

You can check out some examples of `packages` at: `tests/fixtures/packages`

## What is a YDF Packages Directory

A `packages directory` is a directory that contains a list of `packages` and the
`envsubst.env` file, besides it can have one or more `packages selection` files.

For example of a `packages directory`:

```sh
~/.ydf-packages          # packages directory
├── bat/                 # package
├── bmon/                # package
├── htop/                # package
├── aws-cli-v2/          # package
├── mpv/                 # package
├── ....                 # package
├── envsubst.env         # substitution variables
├── pc-gaming.pkgs       # packages selection
├── latop-work.pkgs      # packages selection
└── ....                 # packages selection
```

You can check out: `tests/fixtures/packages`

The `envsubst.env` file has the variables that are evaluated in the files inside
of `Directory instructions` that end with `s`.

The `packages selection` are plain text files that contains a list of `packages`
one per line.

The `packages directory` is where the `interpreter` is going to look for
`packages`, `envsubst.env` and `packages selection`.

## Usage

Reload your shell to load the new PATH.

```sh
exec $SHELL
```

Show the help

```sh
ydf --help
```

```sh
# command output:
Usage:
ydf COMMAND

A tool for managing ydotfiles

Flags:
  -h, --help    Show this help

Management Commands:
  package   Manage packages

Run 'ydf COMMAND --help' for more information on a command.
```

## Add packages to your packages directory

Before adding a `package` to your `packages directory` you must create a git
repository.

```sh
cd ~/.ydf-packages
git init
git remote add origin git@github.com:<your_user>/.ydf-packages.git
```

Open the `packages directory` in your favorite code editor .

```sh
code ~/.ydf-packages
```

Create a `package` and add `instructions` to it.

Add variables to the `~/.ydf-packages/envsubst.env` if apply.

Test that the `package` works.

```sh
ydf package install <package>
```

Verify that the software was installed and configured correctly.

Create a `packages selection` if apply and add the package.

```sh
echo "<package>" >> ~/.ydf-packages/<packages selection>
```

Save the changes.

```sh
cd ~/.ydf-packages
git add .
git commit -m "Add <package>"
git push -u origin master
```

Then when you reinstall your OS or on a new machine you can install all your
packages with:

```sh
ydf packages install <packages-selection>
```

⚠️ Attention: It's highly recommended to test the installation of the packages on a
virtual machine before install them.
